# Test Case Analysis: Control Flow Testing

## Introduction

Control flow testing is a white-box testing methodology that models the program’s internal logic flow to design test cases. In this approach, the source code's structure is used to create a control flow graph (CFG), which represents all possible paths the program can take during execution. Test cases are then derived to exercise specific paths, decisions, and loops in that graph, ensuring that the software’s logic behaves as expected under various conditions. Because it requires knowledge of the code’s structure and implementation, control flow testing is typically performed by developers or white-box testers who have insight into the program’s design. The primary goal is to verify the code’s logic by running through all important control paths (e.g. every decision outcome and loop) so that user requirements are met and hidden logical bugs are uncovered.

## Code Example

Let's say we have the following code
