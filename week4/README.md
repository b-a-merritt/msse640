## ADVANCED EXERCISES

One of the things that trips LLMs up is drawing analog clocks at any time other than 10:10. The reason why LLMs have such difficulty is that, in their training data, nearly every image of a clock has the time 10:10. Advertisements and stock photos use the time 10:10 because it is most aesthetic. Advertisements of clocks with that time sell more. Since LLMs do not think or have an understanding of what a clock does, it cannot understand that the hands move to show the time. As illogical as it sounds, LLMs likely think that the 10:10 position is part of what makes a clock a clock. 

It is important to realize that LLMs will not be able to understand edge behavior from its training data. If everything or nearly everything is alike in its training data, the LLM will not be able to conceive of a different subcategory.
