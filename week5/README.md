### What are some of the AI Assisted Coding tools, e.g. Cursor? Will they replace coding as a skill?
There are many questions loaded into this one. Will it replace coding altogether? No. Will it replace certain type of coding? Yes. In a similar way in which WordPress as a technology replaced the developers of simple blog sites, AI Assisted Coding tools like Copilot, Cursor, etc. will replace the developers of less sophisticated software. Further, were there software engineers who used WordPress as a tool to develop complex software solutions? Yes. In a similar way, some software engineers will use GenAI Coding tools to handle some part of their software. 

### If learning to code will become less important, what new skills will software engineers need to have.

Learning to code will not become less important. It will increase the appetite for software and software engineers will deal with increasing degrees of sophistication. 

### Many think that software engineers will need to develop people skills more than ever. Will AI out perform people in that area as well?

It would be a poor GenAI tool indeed if it is incapable of being polite. It having people skills is a requirement (and otherwise might even be a feature). Humans beings, however, have free will. After a long day or unpleasant experiences, my choice to be polite to someone means more than an AI being trained to say please. I don't think AI is in compitition with software engineers in their ability to communicate with others.
